--- Rakuten Checkout module for Oxid ---
----------------------------------------

          INSTALLATION MANUAL


1. Copy contents from folder "copy_this" to the root of your Oxid store;

2. Merge template from "changed_full" folder with the one that currently exists in your store,
   or if you haven't modified out/basic/tpl/page/checkout/basket.tpl you can just overwrite it
   with the version from the module, "basket.patch" is also provided for your convenience, so
   it'll be easier to track changes you should apply manually to the template. Note that you
   do NOT need to upload patch to the server if you plan just to overwrite the template;

3. Go to the admin -> Master Settings -> Core Settings -> System -> Modules and add the
   following lines there:

   oxbasket => rakuten/rakuten_checkout&rakuten/rakuten_rope
   order_overview => rakuten/rakuten_shiporder
   oxsession => rakuten/rakuten_session

4. Go to the admin -> Shop Settings -> Rakuten Checkout, enable and configure the module;

5. Enjoy!


          UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS
          To upgrade from Tradoria Checkout ver.1.0.2

1. Disable old Tradoria Checkout module via admin -> Shop Settings -> Tradoria Checkout;

2. Note down on the paper or copy&paste all Tradoria Checkout settings, you won't be able
   to access them later;

3. Copy contents from folder "copy_this" to the root of your Oxid store, confirm all
   overwrites;

4. Go to the server to "tmp" folder and delete all contents (to flush Oxid cache);

5. Go to the admin -> Master Settings -> Core Settings -> System -> Modules and replace
   every word "tradoria" with "rakuten", at the end code snippet should look like the
   following lines:

   oxbasket => rakuten/rakuten_checkout&rakuten/rakuten_rope
   order_overview => rakuten/rakuten_shiporder
   oxsession => rakuten/rakuten_session

6. Restart your browser (if it won't help and front-end won't be working properly try to

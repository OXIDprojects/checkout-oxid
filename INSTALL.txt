----------------------------------------

          INSTALLATION MANUAL


1. Copy contents from folder "copy_this" to the root of your Oxid store;

2. Merge template from "changed_full" folder with the one that currently exists in your store,
   or if you haven't modified out/basic/tpl/page/checkout/basket.tpl you can just overwrite it
   with the version from the module, "basket.patch" is also provided for your convenience, so
   it'll be easier to track changes you should apply manually to the template. Note that you
   do NOT need to upload patch to the server if you plan just to overwrite the template;

3. Go to the admin -> Master Settings -> Core Settings -> System -> Modules and add the
   following lines there:

   * oxbasket => rakuten/rakuten_checkout&rakuten/rakuten_rope
   * order_overview => rakuten/rakuten_shiporder
   * oxsession => rakuten/rakuten_session

4. Go to Oxid shop install path/tmp and clear cached smarty templates;

5. Go to the admin -> Shop Settings -> Rakuten Checkout, enable and configure the module;

6. Enjoy!
